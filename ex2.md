# Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```dart
int sumEvenFib(int limit) {

  int sum = 0, start = 0, end = 1;
  int tmpStart;

  while (end < limit) {
    tmpStart = start;
    start = end;
    end = tmpStart + end;
    if (end % 2 == 0) {
      sum += end;
    }

  }
  return sum;

}
```
